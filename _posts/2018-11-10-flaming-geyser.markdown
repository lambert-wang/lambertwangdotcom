One chilly yet sunny Saturday morning, Ben, Jessica, and I drove down to the Flaming Geyser State Park for a nice walk.

Wandering around the park, we eventually found what seemed to be the "geyser." It was a little disappointing, seeing as we were expecting a massive jet of flame to be spewing from the ground. We later looked it up and learned that the geyser used to have an actual flame, but the last time it burned was years ago.

The park was uncrowded save for a few visitors here and there.
We saw some RC aircraft hobbyists partaking in a few flights.
We took in the fall smells and sights as we were guided along a trailed painred a bright orange by the fallen leaves.
