One chilly yet sunny Saturday morning, Ben, Jessica, and I drove down to the Flaming Geyser State Park for a nice walk.
The park was uncrowded save for a few visitors here and there.
We saw some RC aircraft hobbyists partaking in a few flights.
We took in the fall smells and sights as we were guided along a trailed painred a bright orange by the fallen leaves.
