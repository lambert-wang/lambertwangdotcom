If you've ever watched Robot Wars or the Battlebots TV show, then you have an idea of what to imagine when I say "I'm trying to build a battle bot." Sadly, the massive 200 pound death machines often shown on TV are a far cry from what I'm trying to build.

You see, the thing I'm trying to build is a robot for the 1 pound weight class, or the "Antweight" class of robots. 

With every good design, I need to first come up with a plan. Now, since I have never built a battlebot before, the only thing I have to base my ideas from are from what I saw on TV. I thought "Why don't I base my design off of last season's winner and just go smaller from there?"
Well, some things don't quite scale when you shrink them 250x.

What you see above is Bite-Force, a disk spinner with robust wedges lining the front. It was last seen throwing the RioBotz' Minotaur 5 feet into the air. So I knew I wanted to build a disk spinner. With that plan in mind, I designed the weapon first and a drive train to push it into my enemies.

And this is what I came up with. Using my basic Fusion 360 skills, I designed a 2-inch diamter disk spun by a D2822 RC airplane motor (a popular choice for antwights). With a speed of 12100 RPM, the tip speed of this weapon should be just about 72 MPH. Impressed yet?

Being a veteran roboticist, I at least understand that moving parts are bound to fail. That's why I included a massive titanium wedge to cover the front of the robot. If the weapon ever fails to deliver, I at least have a viable ramming weapon that is pretty much impervious to damage (at this weight class).

Well, the robot isn't really much yet. I still have to come up with a way to move it around.

Here's the rest of the robot. Coming it in at just under 16oz, with a frame cut from 1/16" aluminum, it should be an indestructible brick with a terrifying weapon. If only it were actually real...

Despite ordering all of the parts, motors, and sheet metal, I never actually got around to milling out the weapon and frame.

The closest I got was 3D printing out all of the pieces  in plastic for a test fit. I got it driving around while smashing its plastic printed disk against some graham crackers.

Look at all that damage. I think one of the reasons I never went and built the final thing (not the only one) was that I wasn't quite satisfied with the design. And that failed to motivate me to see this robot through to the end. There were a few glaring issues that I came up with while creating this robot that I will definitely address for the next one.

1. The weapon just wasn't very strong.

    Despite the main focus of the design process being the weapon, it just didn't have enough bite or mass to really knock other robots out of the park. The disk was quite thin, and the small diameter and fast speed just mean that a well-connected hit was very unlikely.

2. The mount to the motor is unreliable and risky.

    The motor is definitely not to blame for my issues. What I'm talking about is how the disk is directly mounted to the motor. This is a bad idea for a few reasons. If the weapon ever gets stuck or stalls, then it may destroy the motor as it attempts to spin with no movement. Another reason was that the screws I would be using to hold the disk just aren't tough enough. They probably wouldn't last many hits.

3. The robot has a lot of attack surfaces.

    From the front, the robot is an indestructible wedge. From any other angle, it is a toy just asking to be thrown around by other robots. If I at least thought to curve the wedge down at the sides, it would be much better, but I didn't leave a lot of room in the design for that.

Now enough of the bad, let's talk about the good!

I managed to make it under the weight limit! You may say "But Lambert, every robot fits under the weight limit!" You see, not every antweight is constructed entirely from aluminum with a tool steel disk.

Despite what I said about having a lot of attack surface, if I do get hit, I should be able to survive. The whole shell is decently thick aluminum fastened with a large number of screws and aluminum nut strips. With a little bit of Loctite, the panels aren't going anywhere. I could probably drop this thing from 10 feet and the only damage will be to the hardwood floors of my house.

Now, the 3D printed plastic robot was assembled in December, months before this blog post. The reason I'm posting right now is because I have already come up and created a new design (from scratch) that is both similar to my first one, yet also much better. So stay tuned!

In the mean time, enjoy this nice render of that robot that never happened.
