We packed some snacks and drove out to Snoqualmie Point Park shortly before midnight.

John, Jonas, Yunjae, Ben and I stood together shoulder to shoulder as we braved the cold winds trying to catch a glimpse of a few bright streaks in the sky.
We tried to catch a few shooting stars from the Leonid meteor shower. We didn't see too many shooting stars, but we did see a lot of normal stars.

The line in the sky that you see in this picture isn't actually a shooting star. It's just a plane that I caught with the a long-exposure of my camera.

All of the pictures were a little shaky since the wind was blowing quite strong that night. And also no one could quite hold still for my photos.

This is a photo of what I believe is the Perseus constellation. My star charting is not super strong, so feel free to correct me!

It was my first time really trying to do some nighttime photography.
I'd like to try again sometime, I definitely need some practice.
