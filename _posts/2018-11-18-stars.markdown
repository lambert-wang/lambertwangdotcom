We packed some snacks and drive out to Snoqualmie Point Park shortly before midnight.

John, Jonas, Yunjae, Ben and I stood together shoulder to shoulder as we braved the cold winds trying to catch a glimpse of a few bright streaks in the sky.
We tried to catch a few shooting stars from the Leonid meteor shower. We didn't see too many shooting stars, but we did see a lot of normal stars.
It was my first time really trying to do some nighttime photography.
I'd like to try again sometime, I definitely need some practice.
