Hello! This is my website. Feel free to look around.
I currently live in the Evergreen State.
I enjoy hiking and robotics.

I mostly use this blog to write up about the details of some of my adventures and projects. If you just wanna see some pictures that I take, feel free to check out my Instagram (link in footer).

Feel free to contact me at [lambert.ww@gmail.com](mailto:lambert.ww@gmail.com)
